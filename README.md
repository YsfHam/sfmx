# Simple framework for multimedia projects built with SFML

## Requirements

- SFML rust binding, see <https://docs.rs/sfml/latest/sfml>

## Intoduction

This framework is state machine based.

For a game you could have multiple states:

- Splash screen state: Load some assets for the game
- Game state: handle the in-game events
- Game over state
- Etc.

The sandbox project is used for testing and debugging features.
Some projects to illustrate the usage of this framework will be added as the developement goes.
